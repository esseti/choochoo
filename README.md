##CHOOCHOO
Choochoo is a home-made project that aims at simplifying the searching of trains on trenitalia websites (which owns the data).
So far it implements (and not so well) the searching of delays by train-stops. 

###HOW IT WORKS
The websistes make requests to mobile.viaggiatreno.it and parses the answers (which are plain HTML).
would be terrific if someone starts to build APIs for that. 
This code can be partially reused.

### 4 DEVELOPERS
If you want to use the code, you need to install requests and crispy-forms in a manual way.
the simplest is to install them via pip and then create a symbolic link in the project main folder.   

*PS: if you don't get those two lines, then don't program :)*

### NOTE:
- all the data belongs to trenitalia.
- this is not for profit, so if you (trenitalia) don't like it pls speck up before sue me :)
- the code is badly and partialy commented (sorry, i'll fix once i've time).
- most of the code names are in italian (or pseudo italian).
